# DEW Restaurant

## Description

This is my first **React** project for the **DEW (Web Application Development)** course.  
The application is a restaurant menu that allows users to browse dish categories and see the available meals within each category.

The app uses data from the public API [**TheMealDB**](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php)

## Technologies

- [React](https://es.react.dev/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)

2. Install dependencies:

3. Run the aplication:
```bash

```

## Usage

- The homepage displays the dish categories.
